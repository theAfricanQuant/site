My name is Ricky Macharm, and I am a free lancer based out of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Frankfurt, Germany. I have been in love with the tech world since 2017 when I started learning Python and Machine Learning. I am a financial data scientist with an MSc in Financial Engineering. I have been dabbling in the financial markets since 2007. I intend to use this blog to share my insights in the the areas of Python, Machaine Learning, Algorithmic Trading and Natural Language Processing.
I hope you find the blog useful.
