            "content": "Introduction . In one of our prior studies, we discussed if some days of the week (Mondays through to Fridays) and calendar days of the month (1, 2, 3,...,31) were better for taking long (or short) trades than others. What we next did to test this was to sum up all the returns for each day of the week over the entire period we had data for and see whether the positive or negative returns added up more. The winner then informed us that for each FOREX pair or CDF instrument we considered, a particular day of the week and month was best for longs than for shorts and vice versa. . We take this study further by checking if we could narrow down our results by selecting some weeks of the year to carry our these studies on. We also included the hit ratios for taking these trades. We present the results in the following paragraphs. . Weeks in a year . In 1582, a calendar was introduced to the western world known as the Gregorian calendar (named after Pope Gregory XIII who commissioned it and was more of a minor modification of the Julian calendar which was in use prior and had some issues). A normal year in this calendar has about 365.25 days, which, when divided by the number of days in a week or 7 (got from 1. Monday, 2. Tuesday, 3. Wednesday, 4. Thursday, 5. Friday, 6. Saturday, 7. Sunday) equals 52.17857142857143 weeks in a year. On average we get mostly 52 weeks in a year or 53 weeks. . . Best week of the year . Now we go into the details of the results of our study. What we did was to group our data (from 2010 to 2021) by the weeks of the year and the days of the week then sum up the resulting returns and see if the negative or the positive returns come up tops for each category. We also find the ratio of longs vs shorts for each catergory too just to find the hit rate. . The results are presented below. . Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday . Direction . Bull 0.545455 | 0.636364 | 0.454545 | 0.636364 | 0.363636 | . Bear 0.454545 | 0.363636 | 0.545455 | 0.363636 | 0.636364 | . (image by Author) We are conducting this study on the 47th week of the year 2021, and we are looking at data on this week from 2010 to 2020 while reflecting on how ot could affect our trades in this week. . From the chart above, we can see that this weeks has had more of negative returns historically. However, the ratio chart below the image tells a slightly different story. For a day like Tuesday, though the hit rate for longs are higher than that for shorts, the negative returns added up more for the shorts. . Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday . Direction . Bull 0.714286 | 0.571429 | 0.428571 | 0.714286 | 0.857143 | . Bear 0.285714 | 0.428571 | 0.571429 | 0.285714 | 0.142857 | . (image by Author) What we can see above is the fact that on a Thursday, the GER30 had more hits for longs (about $71 %$) but the total returns all summed up for the period of our study is abysmal at best. For Tuesday, even though the hit rate for longs is a mere $57 %$, the cumulative returns were good. . Conclusion . If I will use this study, my intention is to choose the hit rate and cummultive return that I am confortable with. For instance, on the EURUSD chart we saw, I would love to test out Fridays of the 47th week because the cumulative returns are good and so are the hit rates as they both point at the same direction (shorts). . Does that mean that this Friday the EURUSD is going to close Short? I do not know! Especially as I am writing this on Thursday (the 25th of November 2021 on the 47th week of the year) and I will have to wait a day to find out. .

Appendix 1: Best week of the year to choose the best day of the week to trade on a list of selected FOREX pairs and CFDs . Below are bar charts of the study carried out above on more instruments for your perusal. . My current broker doesn&#39;t have enough data for some currency pairs and CFDs like US30 &amp; GBPAUD for me to carry out this study on them so they are not included here. .

            "content": "Introduction . A lot of folks coming into data science are or coding are doing so with minimal budget. One of the constraints they face is having old machines (desktops or laptops) and installing new software packages on their machines becomes a nightmarish experience. To reduce this barrier to entry, some tools are being made available for free online. For data scientists, Google&#39;s colab is a lifesaver as all you will require is a laptop with internet connection (with a browser of course) and a gmail account. . One favourite IDE for Python developers is the the Visual Studio Code editor, and as a part of the October 2021 release, the editor became available in a zero-install version that runs entirely in your browser. You can access it on your browser by navigating to vscode.dev. Once you’re there, you can open files—and even directories, on supported browsers—and start working. . Some features aren&#39;t supported however (like the terminal and the debugger). You’ll still have a good editing experience with most of the features and extensions you’re familiar with and are used to from the desktop version. . How it works . You can have instant access to code stored on github or azure. Just navigate to the repository of interest and then add vscode.dev in front of the repo&#39;s URL and &quot;voila!&quot; it would be opened inside of the editor. . Lets say you decided to check some of the repositories I have on my github account and you came upon https://github.com/theAfricanQuant/WorldQuant_Python/blob/master/MyGraph.py, the image below is what you would typically see. . . To open it in vscode, all you&#39;d need to do is to type &quot;vscode.dev&quot; to precede the url given above thus: vscode.dev/github.com/theAfricanQuant/WorldQuant_Python/blob/master/MyGraph.py and it will open up as shown below. . . Caveat . When I ran the above for the first time, it asked for permissions and authorization to access my github account (via my login details) so you may want to have an account with github and if possible fork the repository you are looking at if it belongs to someone else. . . . Conclusion . This is a really handy tool for many reasons I would say. Try it out today and let me know your thoughts in the comment section below. Have a nice day and happy coding in Python. .",

            "title": "Best Day of the Week & Month To Trade",
            "content": "In this article, I want to systematically investigate the tendency for different Forex pairs and CFDs to perform better on certain days of the week and month. I will do so by backtesting a simple strategy whereby we buy on the open of a particular day and exit on the close of the same day. We will then sum our performances over the years in question. . We will break our study into 2: . choosing days of the week (Monday through Friday) to see if each of our chosen instruments have preferences for one over tha other; and, | choosing days of the month for the same reason as stated above. | . Some questions on our minds as we explore are: . Do all forex pairs have best trading days of the week and month? | Are these best trading days the same across all pairs or are they different? | can we say the same for CFDs? | . Best Day of the week . Below are different bar charts that represent the cumulative returns if we bought each pair on the open and exited on the close of the same day. . The size of the bars can tell us so much about how the strategy has performed. The longer the bar, the more profitable the strategy is for the day of the week being considered. The days with the most positive bars are best for longs; this doesn&#39;t mean that there were no shorts that would have worked out on those days. Conversely, The days with the most negative bars are best for shorts. . What we can see in the chart above is the fact that Thursdays tend to favor long positions for the EURUSD. So if you took your time to buy on the open of the market on Thursdays and exit the longs at the close of the day, you would be in profit cummulatively at the end of the period being considered. . Fridays are best for shorts. The other days are more of mixed-bags and I would prefer to check other currency pairs or CFDs I am watching to see if they have better days to help me fill up the missing days on this pair. . From what we can see above, if I were to trade this strategy, GBPCHF is best for shorts on Thursdays and Fridays. The Longs are not worth the trouble in my opinion. I will seek out other instruments for those days that are lacking in good trading days. . For the NAS100, it seems from the chart above that long-only strategies would be the best in handling it. Buying on Mondays and letting it ride through Thursday might be one of the best ways to trade this. However I wouldn&#39;t commit funds to any of these strategies yet, as we nned to fully backtest this in-sample and out-sample and bring our some key figures like percentage wins vs loses, Sharpe ratio etc. . Best Day of the Month . What about the possibility of a best trading day of the Month? Larry Williams used the same ideas to trade in the commodities market. As we go through the charts generated below, it would be best to have the same mindset that led us through all the charts for the best day of the week studies above. . From the chart of the GBPJPY above, we can say that the overall best day for longs is the 31st of any month and the best day for shorts are 4th. . We will list the rest of the instruments considered in the appropraite appendix below for you to check and draw your conclusions. . Conclusion . We have come to the end of our study. This writeup is strictly for educational puposes only. Past performance is not an indication of future performances. Please do conduct your own research and come to your own personal conclusions before committing funds to any trading strategy. . May the pips be with you! . Appendix 1: Best day of the week to trade on a list of selected FOREX pairs and CFDs . Below are bar charts of the study carried out above on more instruments for your perusal. .
